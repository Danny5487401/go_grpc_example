# github.com/IBM/sarama
历史: github.com/Shopify/sarama,Shopify 开发的一个 Kafka 库，提供了生产者、消费者、分区消费者等功能




## 生产者

同步阻塞生产者: 效率较低
```go
// github.com/!i!b!m/sarama@v1.43.3/sync_producer.go
type SyncProducer interface {
	
	SendMessage(msg *ProducerMessage) (partition int32, offset int64, err error)

	// SendMessages produces a given set of messages, and returns only when all
	// messages in the set have either succeeded or failed. Note that messages
	// can succeed and fail individually; if some succeed and some fail,
	// SendMessages will return an error.
	SendMessages(msgs []*ProducerMessage) error

	// 必须手动关闭,否则会泄露
	Close() error

	// TxnStatus return current producer transaction status.
	TxnStatus() ProducerTxnStatusFlag

	// IsTransactional return true when current producer is transactional.
	IsTransactional() bool

	// BeginTxn mark current transaction as ready.
	BeginTxn() error

	// CommitTxn commit current transaction.
	CommitTxn() error

	// AbortTxn abort current transaction.
	AbortTxn() error

	// AddOffsetsToTxn add associated offsets to current transaction.
	AddOffsetsToTxn(offsets map[string][]*PartitionOffsetMetadata, groupId string) error

	// AddMessageToTxn add message offsets to current transaction.
	AddMessageToTxn(msg *ConsumerMessage, groupId string, metadata *string) error
}

```


## 消费者

分区消费者

```go
type Consumer interface {
	// Topics returns the set of available topics as retrieved from the cluster
	// metadata. This method is the same as Client.Topics(), and is provided for
	// convenience.
	Topics() ([]string, error)

	// Partitions returns the sorted list of all partition IDs for the given topic.
	// This method is the same as Client.Partitions(), and is provided for convenience.
	Partitions(topic string) ([]int32, error)

	// ConsumePartition creates a PartitionConsumer on the given topic/partition with
	// the given offset. It will return an error if this Consumer is already consuming
	// on the given topic/partition. Offset can be a literal offset, or OffsetNewest
	// or OffsetOldest
	ConsumePartition(topic string, partition int32, offset int64) (PartitionConsumer, error)

	// HighWaterMarks returns the current high water marks for each topic and partition.
	// Consistency between partitions is not guaranteed since high water marks are updated separately.
	HighWaterMarks() map[string]map[int32]int64

	// Close shuts down the consumer. It must be called after all child
	// PartitionConsumers have already been closed.
	Close() error

	// Pause suspends fetching from the requested partitions. Future calls to the broker will not return any
	// records from these partitions until they have been resumed using Resume()/ResumeAll().
	// Note that this method does not affect partition subscription.
	// In particular, it does not cause a group rebalance when automatic assignment is used.
	Pause(topicPartitions map[string][]int32)

	// Resume resumes specified partitions which have been paused with Pause()/PauseAll().
	// New calls to the broker will return records from these partitions if there are any to be fetched.
	Resume(topicPartitions map[string][]int32)

	// PauseAll suspends fetching from all partitions. Future calls to the broker will not return any
	// records from these partitions until they have been resumed using Resume()/ResumeAll().
	// Note that this method does not affect partition subscription.
	// In particular, it does not cause a group rebalance when automatic assignment is used.
	PauseAll()

	// ResumeAll resumes all partitions which have been paused with Pause()/PauseAll().
	// New calls to the broker will return records from these partitions if there are any to be fetched.
	ResumeAll()
}

```



消费组

```go
type ConsumerGroup interface {
	// Consume joins a cluster of consumers for a given list of topics and
	// starts a blocking ConsumerGroupSession through the ConsumerGroupHandler.
	//
	// The life-cycle of a session is represented by the following steps:
	//
	// 1. The consumers join the group (as explained in https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_consumers)
	//    and is assigned their "fair share" of partitions, aka 'claims'.
	// 2. Before processing starts, the handler's Setup() hook is called to notify the user
	//    of the claims and allow any necessary preparation or alteration of state.
	// 3. For each of the assigned claims the handler's ConsumeClaim() function is then called
	//    in a separate goroutine which requires it to be thread-safe. Any state must be carefully protected
	//    from concurrent reads/writes.
	// 4. The session will persist until one of the ConsumeClaim() functions exits. This can be either when the
	//    parent context is canceled or when a server-side rebalance cycle is initiated.
	// 5. Once all the ConsumeClaim() loops have exited, the handler's Cleanup() hook is called
	//    to allow the user to perform any final tasks before a rebalance.
	// 6. Finally, marked offsets are committed one last time before claims are released.
	//
	// Please note, that once a rebalance is triggered, sessions must be completed within
	// Config.Consumer.Group.Rebalance.Timeout. This means that ConsumeClaim() functions must exit
	// as quickly as possible to allow time for Cleanup() and the final offset commit. If the timeout
	// is exceeded, the consumer will be removed from the group by Kafka, which will cause offset
	// commit failures.
	// This method should be called inside an infinite loop, when a
	// server-side rebalance happens, the consumer session will need to be
	// recreated to get the new claims.
	Consume(ctx context.Context, topics []string, handler ConsumerGroupHandler) error

	// Errors returns a read channel of errors that occurred during the consumer life-cycle.
	// By default, errors are logged and not returned over this channel.
	// If you want to implement any custom error handling, set your config's
	// Consumer.Return.Errors setting to true, and read from this channel.
	Errors() <-chan error

	// Close stops the ConsumerGroup and detaches any running sessions. It is required to call
	// this function before the object passes out of scope, as it will otherwise leak memory.
	Close() error

	// Pause suspends fetching from the requested partitions. Future calls to the broker will not return any
	// records from these partitions until they have been resumed using Resume()/ResumeAll().
	// Note that this method does not affect partition subscription.
	// In particular, it does not cause a group rebalance when automatic assignment is used.
	Pause(partitions map[string][]int32)

	// Resume resumes specified partitions which have been paused with Pause()/PauseAll().
	// New calls to the broker will return records from these partitions if there are any to be fetched.
	Resume(partitions map[string][]int32)

	// Pause suspends fetching from all partitions. Future calls to the broker will not return any
	// records from these partitions until they have been resumed using Resume()/ResumeAll().
	// Note that this method does not affect partition subscription.
	// In particular, it does not cause a group rebalance when automatic assignment is used.
	PauseAll()

	// Resume resumes all partitions which have been paused with Pause()/PauseAll().
	// New calls to the broker will return records from these partitions if there are any to be fetched.
	ResumeAll()
}
